        Lived 1815 â€“ 1852. Born two centuries ago, Ada Lovelace was a pioneer of
        computing science. She took part in writing the first published program
        and was a computing visionary, recognizing for the first time that
        computers could do much more than just calculations. Lovelace was a
        visionary: she understood that numbers could be used to represent more
        than just quantities, and a machine that could manipulate numbers could
        be made to manipulate any data represented by numbers. Lovelace died of
        cancer in 1852, when she was only 36. More than 150 years later, we
        remember her contributions to science and engineering in the celebration
        of Ada Lovelace Day on October 13. First celebrated in 2009 (in March),
        it is a day set aside to learn about women in science, technology,
        engineering, and mathematics.
